## Startech Demo

This app is a simple demonstration of what a React Native app might look like 
(if it was done in a rush by developers who don't care about design or writing nice code).  

The project was bootstrapped with 
[Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
Check [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md)
for information about available commands and how this thing works. 

The basis for the demonstration code was stolen with permission from a [previous demonstration](https://github.com/yedidyak/hacakthonChat/)
 by [Yedidya Kennard](https://github.com/yedidyak).
